# ✅ Smart Email Filtering Implemented

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### 1. ❌ Repayment Emails (Image 1)
**Before:** "Thank You! We received payment for your LazyPay dues" was being tracked
**Issue:** This is YOU paying back the BNPL, not a purchase
**Solution:** ✅ Now skipped automatically

### 2. ❌ Bill Summary Emails (Image 2)
**Before:** "Your LazyPay Dues ₹1979.19" was being tracked
**Issue:** This is the total bill, not an individual purchase
**Solution:** ✅ Now skipped automatically

### 3. ❌ Duplicate Invoices (Image 3)
**Before:** Same Myntra purchase (₹2075) appeared twice
**Issue:** Both LazyPay and Simpl send confirmation emails for same purchase
**Solution:** ✅ Duplicate detection - only counts once

## 🔍 How It Works

### Skip Patterns
The system now automatically skips emails containing:

#### Repayment Confirmations
- "Thank you" + "received" + "payment"
- "Payment received"
- "Successfully paid"

#### Bill Summaries / Dues
- "Your LazyPay Dues"
- "Your Simpl Dues"
- "Bill Summary"
- "Total Due"
- "Pay Now"
- "Outstanding amount"

#### Unknown Merchants
- Any email where merchant can't be detected
- Generic BNPL emails without vendor info

### Duplicate Detection
Considers an invoice a duplicate if:
- ✅ Same merchant name
- ✅ Same amount (within ₹0.01)
- ✅ Same date (within 1 hour)

**Example:**
```
Invoice 1: Myntra, ₹2075.00, Oct 17 01:15 PM
Invoice 2: Myntra, ₹2075.00, Oct 17 01:20 PM
→ Second one is SKIPPED as duplicate
```

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

### ✅ Valid Purchase Invoices
- "LazyPay has paid **Swiggy** on your behalf" - ₹147
- "₹129.0 on **Swiggy** charged via Simpl"
- "**Myntra** order confirmation" - ₹2075

### ❌ Skipped Emails
- "Thank You! Payment received" (repayment)
- "Your LazyPay Dues ₹1979" (bill summary)
- "Unknown Merchant" (no vendor detected)
- Duplicate invoices

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### extractionService.js
```javascript
function shouldSkipEmail(subject, text) {
  const skipPatterns = [
    /thank you.*received.*payment/i,
    /your.*dues/i,
    /pay now/i,
    // ... more patterns
  ];
  
  // Returns true if email should be skipped
}
```

### gmailService.js
```javascript
// Parse email
const parsed = parseEmail(detail.data);

// Skip if null (repayment/dues/unknown)
if (!parsed) continue;

// Check for duplicates
const isDuplicate = allInvoices.some(inv => 
  inv.merchant === parsed.merchant && 
  Math.abs(inv.amount - parsed.amount) < 0.01 &&
  sameDate
);

if (isDuplicate) {
  console.log('🔄 DUPLICATE: Skipping');
  continue;
}
```
