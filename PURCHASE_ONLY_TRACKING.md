# ✅ Purchase-Only Tracking - Fixed!

## 🎯 What Changed

### NEW Logic: Only Process Purchase Emails

**Emails MUST contain one of these indicators:**
- "charged via" (₹130 on Zepto charged via Simpl)
- "added to bill" (₹691 added to your Simpl Bill)
- "added to your" (added to your bill)
- "has paid" (LazyPay has paid Swiggy)
- "purchase of" (purchase of Rs.1014 on Zepto)
- "payment successful on" (Payment successful on Zepto)
- "payment of" (payment of ₹500)
- "on behalf" (on your behalf)

**If email doesn't have these → SKIPPED**

### Emails That Are SKIPPED

1. **Payment Completions** (You finished paying back)
   - "All scheduled Pay in 3 payments complete"
   - → SKIPPED

2. **Repayment Confirmations**
   - "Payment Received" (no vendor)
   - "Thank You!" (no vendor)
   - → SKIPPED

3. **Bill Summaries / Dues**
   - "Your LazyPay Dues ₹1979"
   - "Total Due"
   - "Pay Now"
   - → SKIPPED

4. **Promotional Emails**
   - "Flat ₹100 off"
   - → SKIPPED

5. **Account Activation**
   - "LazyPay Account Activated!"
   - → SKIPPED

6. **Refunds**
   - "Woohoo! A refund!"
   - → Will be skipped (no purchase indicator)

## ✅ Valid Purchase Emails

### Example 1: ₹130 on Zepto charged via Simpl
```
Subject: ₹130.05 on Zepto. charged via Simpl
✅ Has purchase indicator: "charged via"
✅ Merchant: Zepto
✅ Amount: ₹130.05
→ TRACKED
```

### Example 2: Pay-in-3 second payment added to bill
```
Subject: Pay-in-3 second payment of ₹691.66 has been added to your Simpl Bill
✅ Has purchase indicator: "added to your"
✅ Merchant: Myntra (detected from content)
✅ Amount: ₹691.66
→ TRACKED
```

### Example 3: LazyPay has paid Swiggy
```
Subject: LazyPay has paid Swiggy on your behalf
✅ Has purchase indicator: "has paid"
✅ Merchant: Swiggy
✅ Amount: ₹147
→ TRACKED
```

### Example 4: Payment successful on Zepto
```
Subject: Payment successful on Zepto. using Simpl Pay in 3
✅ Has purchase indicator: "payment successful on"
✅ Merchant: Zepto
✅ Amount: ₹1014.04
→ TRACKED
```

## ❌ Skipped Emails (Not Purchases)

### Example 1: Payment completion (you paid back)
```
Subject: All scheduled Pay in 3 payments complete for your purchase of Rs.1014.04 on Zepto
⏭️  SKIPPED: Payment completion email (you paid back)
→ NOT TRACKED
```

### Example 2: Repayment confirmation
```
Subject: Payment Received
⏭️  SKIPPED: Repayment confirmation
→ NOT TRACKED
```

### Example 3: Promotional email
```
Subject: As quick as it gets. Flat ₹100 off on Instamart
⏭️  SKIPPED: Promotional email
→ NOT TRACKED
```

### Example 4: Account activation
```
Subject: LazyPay Account Activated!
⏭️  SKIPPED: Account activation email
→ NOT TRACKED
```

### Example 5: Transaction details (no purchase indicator)
```
Subject: LazyPay Transaction Details - Zepto
⏭️  SKIPPED: No purchase indicator (charged/added/paid)
→ NOT TRACKED (unless email body has "charged" or "added")
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Check if email should be skipped
```javascript
// Skip dues, promotions, account activation, payment completions
if (shouldSkipEmail(subject, text)) {
  return null;
}
```

### Step 2: Check if email has purchase indicator
```javascript
// Must have "charged", "added to bill", "has paid", etc.
if (!isValidPurchaseEmail(subject, text)) {
  return null; // No purchase indicator → skip
}
```

### Step 3: Extract data
```javascript
// Extract merchant, amount, date
const merchant = detectBrand(text);
const amount = extractAmount(text);
```

### Step 4: Duplicate check
```javascript
// Same merchant + amount + date → skip duplicate
if (isDuplicate) {
  console.log('🔄 DUPLICATE');
  continue;
}
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before (Old Logic)
- Tracked: Purchases + Repayments + Dues + Promos
- Result: Inflated spending, duplicates

### After (New Logic)
- Tracked: ONLY actual purchases with clear indicators
- Result: Accurate spending, no duplicates

## 🚀 Test It

1. **Clear database**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node clear-db.js
   ```

2. **Restart backend**

3. **Click Sync**

4. **Check logs** - you'll see:
   ```
   ✅ Tracked: ₹130 on Zepto charged via Simpl
   ⏭️  SKIPPED: All scheduled payments complete
   ⏭️  SKIPPED: Payment Received
   ⏭️  SKIPPED: No purchase indicator
   🔄 DUPLICATE: Myntra ₹2075
   ```

**Your dashboard will now show ONLY real purchases!** 🎉
