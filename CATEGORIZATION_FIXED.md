### 3. Improved Merchant Detection

Added better pattern matching for LazyPay/Simpl emails:
- "LazyPay has paid **Swiggy**" → Merchant: Swiggy
- "₹129.0 on **Swiggy** charged via Simpl" → Merchant: Swiggy
- "at **Blinkit**" → Merchant: Blinkit

### 4. Debug Logging

Added detailed logs to track:
- ✅ When BNPL pattern matches
- ✅ Which merchant was found
- ✅ Which category it belongs to
- ⚠️ When merchant can't be detected (Unknown Merchant)

## 🔍 Finding "Unknown Merchant"

When you sync, check backend logs for:
```
⚠️  Could not detect merchant from text: "..."
```

This will show you the email content that couldn't be matched. You can then:
1. Add the merchant to the appropriate category in `extractionService.js`
2. Or improve the BNPL pattern matching

## 🎨 Frontend Updates

### CategoryBreakdown.jsx
- Added groceries icon: 🛒 ShoppingCart
- Color: Emerald (green)

### TransactionsTable.jsx
- Added groceries category
- Proper icon and color coding

## 📊 Category Colors

```javascript
Food: Orange (🍔 Utensils)
Groceries: Emerald (🛒 ShoppingCart)
Shopping: Blue (🛍️ ShoppingBag)
Travel: Green (✈️ Plane)
Bills: Red (⚡ Zap)
Entertainment: Purple (🎮 Gamepad2)
```

## 🚀 Test It

1. Clear database (optional - to re-categorize):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node clear-db.js
   ```

2. Restart backend (to load new categories)

3. Sync invoices

4. Check logs for merchant detection

5. See groceries as separate category!
