# 🔍 Debug Instructions

## What to do:

1. **Go to the dashboard** at http://localhost:5173/dashboard
2. **Click the "Sync" button** to fetch invoices
3. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for processing
4. **Come back here** and let me know it's done

## What I'll check:

The backend console will now show detailed logs including:
- 📧 How many emails were found
- 📬 First email's full details (subject, from, body preview)
- 🔍 Processing status for each email
- ✅/❌ Extraction success/failure
- 💾 What data was saved to database

This will help us identify exactly where the extraction is failing!
