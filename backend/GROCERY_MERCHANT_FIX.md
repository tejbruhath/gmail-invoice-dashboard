# ✅ Grocery Merchant Detection - Enhanced

## 🎯 Issue
Blinkit, Zepto, and JioMart invoices from LazyPay/Simpl were not being detected properly due to merchant name variations in emails.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced BNPL Pattern Matching

**Before:**
```javascript
/(?:paid|has paid)\s+([a-z]+)/i  // Only matches single words
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Supports multi-word merchant names
/(?:paid|has paid)\s+([a-z\s]+?)(?:\s+on|\.|\s+private)/i
/on\s+([a-z\s\.]+?)\s+charged/i
/on\s+([a-z]+?)\./i  // "on Zepto."
```

### 2. Merchant Name Variations Mapping

Added official merchant names that appear in emails:

```javascript
const merchantVariations = {
  'blink commerce': 'blinkit',          // LazyPay uses "Blink Commerce"
  'zepto marketplace': 'zepto',         // Simpl uses "Zepto Marketplace"
  'jio mart': 'jiomart',                // Emails have space
  'big basket': 'bigbasket'             // Emails have space
}
```

### 3. Flexible Matching

Now checks if:
- `merchantMatch.includes(word)` - e.g., "blink commerce" includes "blinkit"? No, but...
- `word.includes(merchantMatch)` - e.g., "zepto" is in "zepto marketplace"? Yes!
