# ✅ Enhanced Filtering & Duplicate Prevention

## 🎯 Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ Payback Emails Still Being Tracked
**Issue:** "Thank You!" repayment emails were still getting through
**Solution:** ✅ Strengthened skip patterns with more aggressive filtering

### 2. ❌ Invoices Duplicated 2-3 Times
**Issue:** Same invoice appearing multiple times (Myntra ₹2075 × 3)
**Solution:** ✅ Multi-layer duplicate detection

## 🔒 Enhanced Skip Patterns

### Repayment Emails (YOU paying back BNPL)
Now catches ALL variations:
- "Thank you"
- "Payment received"
- "We have received"
- "Successfully paid"
- "Payment successful"

### Bill Summaries (Total bill, not individual purchase)
- "Your LazyPay Dues"
- "Your Simpl Dues"
- "Bill Summary"
- "Total Due"
- "Pay Now"
- "Due Date"
- "Clear your dues"
- "Reminder"

### Smart Detection
If email contains "thank" or "received" BUT no merchant name like:
- "paid Swiggy"
- "on Zomato"
- "at Blinkit"

→ **Automatically skipped**

## 🛡️ Multi-Layer Duplicate Detection

### Layer 1: In-Memory (During Fetch)
When fetching emails, checks if invoice already exists in current batch:
- ✅ Same merchant (case-insensitive)
- ✅ Same amount (within ₹0.01)
- ✅ Same date (within 24 hours)

**Example:**
```
Email 1: Swiggy ₹147 @ 2:00 PM
Email 2: SWIGGY ₹147.00 @ 2:05 PM
→ Email 2 SKIPPED (duplicate in batch)
```

### Layer 2: Database Check (Before Save)
Before saving, checks if similar invoice already exists in database:
- ✅ Same merchant
- ✅ Same amount (±₹0.01)
- ✅ Same date (±1 day)

**Example:**
```
Database: Myntra ₹2075 on Oct 17
New: Myntra ₹2075 on Oct 17
→ SKIPPED (duplicate in database)
```

### Layer 3: Email ID Check
Also checks if the exact same email was already processed:
- ✅ Same emailId

## 📊 How It Works

### Step 1: Email Filtering
```javascript
// Skip repayment/dues emails
if (shouldSkipEmail(subject, text)) {
  console.log('⏭️  SKIPPED: Repayment/Dues/Reminder email');
  return null;
}

// Skip unknown merchants
if (merchant === 'Unknown Merchant') {
  console.log('⏭️  SKIPPED: No valid merchant detected');
  return null;
}
```

### Step 2: In-Memory Duplicate Check
```javascript
const isDuplicate = allInvoices.some(inv => {
  const sameDate = timeDiff < 24 hours;
  const sameAmount = Math.abs(inv.amount - parsed.amount) < 0.01;
  const sameMerchant = inv.merchant.toLowerCase() === parsed.merchant.toLowerCase();
  
  return sameMerchant && sameAmount && sameDate;
});

if (isDuplicate) {
  console.log('🔄 DUPLICATE: Already in batch');
  continue;
}
```

### Step 3: Database Duplicate Check
```javascript
const existingDuplicate = await Invoice.findOne({
  userId,
  merchant: invoiceData.merchant,
  amount: { $gte: amount - 0.01, $lte: amount + 0.01 },
  date: { $gte: oneDayBefore, $lte: oneDayAfter }
});

if (existingDuplicate) {
  console.log('🔄 DUPLICATE: Already in database');
  continue;
}
```

## 🎯 What Gets Tracked vs Skipped

### ✅ Tracked (Valid Purchases)
- "LazyPay has paid Swiggy" - ₹147
- "₹129 on Swiggy charged via Simpl"
- "Myntra order confirmation" - ₹2075
- "Blinkit delivery" - ₹450

### ❌ Skipped (Not Purchases)
- "Thank You! Payment received" (repayment)
- "Your LazyPay Dues ₹1979" (bill summary)
- "Reminder: Clear your dues" (reminder)
- "Unknown Merchant" (no vendor)
- Duplicate invoices (2nd, 3rd occurrence)

## 🚀 Test It

1. **Clear database** (recommended to remove old duplicates):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node clear-db.js
   ```

2. **Restart backend**

3. **Click Sync**

4. **Check logs** - you'll see:
   - ⏭️  SKIPPED for repayments/dues
   - 🔄 DUPLICATE for duplicate invoices
   - ✅ Only unique, valid purchases saved

## 📈 Expected Results

- 30 invoices saved (including duplicates and repayments)
- Dashboard shows inflated numbers

### After
